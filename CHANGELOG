*v0.0.1 (CLI)

Enter the username and password of *the System*, and directly get the page of your timetable(Timetable.html).

The bug of this version:
Open the page with browser except Chrome will get a messy code, because the website developer didn't point out the label "meta charset".
Later will try to add the label manually.
