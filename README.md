# WUT-Tools

This project is designed to make a series of tools that make getting imformation from *WUT(WHUT) Educational Administration System* more convenient. Though Python will be easier to program for network programming, it used C++ as its main programming language.

This project uses a famous C network library named [libcurl](https://github.com/curl/curl), which is also widely used in PHP. This library has been statically compiled with VS2015, for the project is developed with VS. In other words, you can develop it yourself with VS2015.

These tools will include versions of CLI, GUI and even QQ(Based on the project [sjdy521/Mojo-Webqq](https://github.com/sjdy521/Mojo-Webqq)).

This is my first time to try making a *REAL* project, and I will update my progress and change log under this line.

Arrange codes and change the codes of class HttpReq and LessonSheetReq.

Create README.md.

The file "getLessonDemo.cpp" is a demo written in C. Recent work is to rebuild it with c++. That's why those classes created.
